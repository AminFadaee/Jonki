I love taking notes. Love is a strong word though, I need to take notes. I have a crappy
memory! There! I said it! 

I hate it when I learn something just to forget it after a
couple of weeks. I landed on [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) as note taking solution. 
It was well designed, it had everything I needed. Specially I could do all kinds of crap
with the notes because they are accessible through the [API](https://joplinapp.org/api/references/rest_api/).

The other thing I love is Anki! Having what you learnt in a note is great and all, but having
it in my memory too would be awesome.

So, I am working on this script that creates Anki flash cards off of my notes.
It is still in progress though but I may turn it into an Anki plugin.
